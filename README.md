this is an implementation to a general binary bit comparator in matlap with extra features described below. 

## the contents :
comparator function that takes two numbers as an input.
Main script that offer the uesr the features of the app.
simulink model.
app packege ready to  install and use.

## the app features
the app offer the user 3 main features.
1-  comparing two binary numbers of any size and output the result in two forms text and the logic cases.
2- files compare: take  the path of the two files and compare the two files and show the result in a table .
side note on file:   if the length of the two files is not equal the code  ignore the long file extra rows.

3- simulation part.
this part is exclusice only to 3 bit binary numbers .
this part has two main choises .
    1- show an image  to the simulation result.
    2- open simulink and run the simulation.
the simulation is on gate level with a lamp on every case  that turn red if false and green if true.

## issues
that the simulation only to 3 bit numbers  .
in the future i wil add an ML model that can generate thoses  logical curcuits!
